This is a small utility to configure and create a wayland security context.

A wayland security context allows connecting unprivleged clients to the compositor.

This tool is not a sandbox on its own, it's intended to be used with bwrap. The unix socket
that you provide as an argument should be bind mounted into the sandbox, the regular socket
should be excluded from the sandbox, otherwise clients can bypass the security context.

See the examples directory for usage.
